COM_ENGAGE_CONFIG_MAX_LEVEL_LABEL="Maximum comment nesting"
COM_ENGAGE_CONFIG_MAX_LEVEL_DESC="<p>Comments can be nested up to this many levels deep. For example, 3 levels means that you have top level comments (1<sup>st</sup> level), replies to top level comments (2<sup>nd</sup> level) and replies to the replies (3<sup>rd</sup> level). Keep this relative low for more cohesive discussion and more reasonable display of comments.</p><p>The default is 3, similar to what is used by other content comment systems your visitors are familiar with, e.g. Discus, WordPress etc. Set it to 2 to simulate what social media such as Facebook or YouTube do. Use 1 to disallow nesting (only top level comments allowed).</p><p><strong>THIS SETTING IS NOT APPLIED RETROACTIVELY.</strong> It only takes effect for new replies. Setting it to a lower value won't “flatten” your existing comment threads.</p><p>This setting CAN NOT be overriden for specific categories or articles.</p>"

COM_ENGAGE_DEFAULT_PUBLISH_DESC="<p>Should newly filed comments be published or unpublished by default? In the latter case a comment administrator needs to manually publish them.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> This option does NOT apply to comments published by comment administrators. These comments are always published immediately. It would be nonsensical asking the user submitting such a comment to moderate their own comment.</p>"

COM_ENGAGE_COMMENTS_CLOSE_AFTER_LABEL="Close comments after this many days"
COM_ENGAGE_COMMENTS_CLOSE_AFTER_DESC="Comments will be closed automatically after this many days since the article was published. 0 is a special value and it means that the comments will never be closed automatically. This setting can be overridden in specific categories and / or articles."

COM_ENGAGE_CONFIG_CAPTCHA_DESC="<p>Select the CAPTCHA plugin that will be used in the comments form. You may need to enter required information for your CAPTCHA plugin in the Plugin Manager.</p><p>If “Use Global” is selected, make sure a CAPTCHA plugin is selected in Joomla's Global Configuration.</p><p>This setting CAN NOT be overriden for specific categories or articles.</p>"

This option determines which module will be used in the login area.</p><p>Please note that Akeeba Engage will <strong>always</strong> display all modules published in the <code>engage-login</code> module position, regardless of this setting.</p><p>Due to limitations in how Joomla works, any module selected here will be loaded with <em>its default configuration</em>. This may not be useful for most sites. We recommend that you select the option “( Do not display )“ here and instead publish any custom HTML and login modules in the <code>engage-login</code> module position.</p><p>Naturally, if you set this to “( Do not display )“ and you don't publish any modules in the <code>engage-login</code> position the login area feature is completely disabled.</p>"
