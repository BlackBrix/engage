<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Full support for the Newsflash module</strong>.
	The Newsflash module renders articles pretending it's com_content. This is a violation of what the rendering context is meant to convey in Joomla. This caused comments to be displayed in the Newsflash module. We now detect this and do not display the comments at all.
