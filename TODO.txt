Comments display, display following links based on privileges:
    core.edit / core.edit.own
        Edit
    core.edit.state
        Publish / Unpublish
    core.manage / core.admin
        IP Information https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/{ip}
        Also show spam rating info (may have to add a params field...)

If I am a manager show me all comments, regardless of state.
    But do visually differentiate unpublished (state=0) and spam (state=3) comments!

Edit page
    core.edit can also edit name and email if created_by is empty
    core.edit can also see and edit the IP address of the user filing the comment
    core.edit.own can only change the body text

Deleting an item should promote its children one level up.

Akismet integration plugin
    Spam is automatically unpublished (state: -3)

Project Honeypot integration plugin

Send email notifications for new comments
    The plugin is triggered by the onAfterSave event of the Comments model and only in the frontend.
    Therefore it knows if it's a new comment or existing record being updated.
    Same idea as Akeeba Subscriptions emails, really.

    Content plugins convey manager email information for the asset (name, email address)
    This is merged with the component admins (core.manage or core.admin) to get manager emails

    Managers are always emailed for new comments, even if the comment is unpublished by default
        State 0 (Unpublished): A new comment needs to be approved
        State 1 (Published): A new comment was posted
        State -3 (Spam): A new comment awaits moderation

    If the comment is 2nd level or above we consider emailing the parent comment's author and all of the parent's children on the same level as our new comment but ONLY if it's published (state=1)
        If it's a new comment we REMOVE the email addresses of the managers from that list of users to notify.


Display: show "In reply to [name]" for 2nd level and deeper replies, linking back to the comment on the same page.
    If the comment is not part of the items set, DO NOT make this a link.

Display: when a parent is unpublished display a phantom comment ("This comment has been unpublished").

Backend interface
