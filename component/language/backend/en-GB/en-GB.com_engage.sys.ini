COM_ENGAGE_CONFIG_MAX_LEVEL_LABEL="Maximum comment nesting"
COM_ENGAGE_CONFIG_MAX_LEVEL_DESC="<p>Comments can be nested up to this many levels deep. For example, 3 levels means that you have top level comments (1<sup>st</sup> level), replies to top level comments (2<sup>nd</sup> level) and replies to the replies (3<sup>rd</sup> level). Keep this relative low for more cohesive discussion and more reasonable display of comments.</p><p>The default is 3, similar to what is used by other content comment systems your visitors are familiar with, e.g. Discus, WordPress etc. Set it to 2 to simulate what social media such as Facebook or YouTube do. Use 1 to disallow nesting (only top level comments allowed).</p><p><strong>THIS SETTING IS NOT APPLIED RETROACTIVELY.</strong> It only takes effect for new replies. Setting it to a lower value won't “flatten” your existing comment threads.</p>"
