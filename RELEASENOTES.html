<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Comments count summary can now be displayed before or after content</strong>
	(<a href="https://github.com/akeeba/engage/issues/51" target="_blank">gh-51</a>).
	You can now choose if the comment count summary will be displayed before or after the article content in Joomla's
	articles blog view. You can further customize it by doing Joomla layout overrides for the layouts <code>akeeba.engage.content.category</code> and <code>akeeba.engage.content.featured</code>, found in the plugins/content/engage/layouts folder.

<p>
	<strong>Bug fixes and minor improvements</strong>. Please take a look at the CHANGELOG below.
</p>

<h3>Joomla! versions supported</h3>
<p>
	We only officially support using our software with the latest Joomla! release branch, 3.9. We strongly advise you to run the latest available version of Joomla! for security reasons. Older versions of Joomla! have known major security issues which are being actively exploited to hack sites.
</p>
<p>
	Our software should run on Joomla 4.0 which is currently in Beta. Please note that Joomla 4 is not stable yet. It
	should not be used on production sites. Some breakage is expected; we are working on fixing issues on Joomla 4 but
	it may take a while since it's still changing, albeit not at the rate it was changing pre-Beta.
</p>

<h3>PHP versions supported</h3>
<p>
	We only officially support using our software with PHP 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4. We strongly advise you to run the latest available version of PHP on a branch currently maintained by the PHP project for security reasons. Older versions of PHP have known major security issues which are being actively exploited to hack sites and they have stopped receiving security updates, leaving you exposed to these issues.
</p>
<p>
	Please note that earlier PHP versions including but not limited to PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 7.0 are no longer supported and our software no longer works on them.
