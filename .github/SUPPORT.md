You can receive community support through the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/akeeba/engage/discussions) of Akeeba Engage's GitHub repository. Kindly note that this is meant to server as a place where users of Akeeba Engage help each other, in a way similar to how Stack Overflow works. We may pop in from time to time to give an answer — especially at the beginning when the volume of discussions is pretty low — but our involvement in these discussions is not guaranteed. Thank you for your understanding!
