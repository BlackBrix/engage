<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Converted all tables to InnoDB for better performance</strong>. The database tables are now created using
																		  the InnoDB database engine. This wasn't possible before, when we were still supporting older Joomla versions which
																		  did not have that requirement. InnoDB is a much faster database table than MyISAM, the previous default, leading to
																		  better performance during database heavy operations. Your existing tables will be updated during installation or
																		  when you visit the backend control panel page of the component.
