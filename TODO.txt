Some ideas for the future (not necessarily to be implemented, these are wild ideas)...

Per-category or per-article comment settings
    Comment privilege injected in com_content / com_categories?
    How does that interact with the com_engage privilege?
    Do I need my own permissions checker instead of going through Joomla?
    Maybe leave it for version 2?
